# password-generator

## what was the goal of this project?

 - The goal of this project was to create a password generator webpage that asks you a series of prompts and in return generates you a password that fits your criteria. I achieved this by starting off by listing all of the global variables that would be needed for this project like all the character classes for example. I then had to create a function that asked you a series of prompts determining how long you want your password to be and also what character classes you want to have included in your password. After all of the prompts are answered the generate password function takes all of that info and creates a random password for you using a random generator. After that is done the writePassword function displays your newly generated password out on the page. Lastly, you can proceed to keep generating new passwords over and over again by clicking the "generate" button based off of the criteria you provided.
